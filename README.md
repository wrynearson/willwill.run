Activities of type `Run` (which include normal runs and trail runs) are fetched daily from Strava. When a listed run is selected, it is displayed on the map, along with basic information including:

- Run name
- Distance
- Pace
- Run type (normal or trail)
- Elevation gain

## Development

Strava authentication and API documentation can be found [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/).

The React application can be run locally with `npm start`.
